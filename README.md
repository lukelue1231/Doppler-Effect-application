Simulation of a flying object, and estimation of its direction.

The prerequisite is that we have 6 sound detectors, which can detector the moving object's sound frequency shift.

The idea begins from detection of sniper's bullet. Other applications is like, to detect aircrafts or missles that can avoid radar's detection. I'm still thinking of some beneficial uses.
